# Algebraic Equation GPT V3.5

This repo experiments with Image text recognition API,Speech to Text API and LLMs.
A Photo or an image containing Mathematics Equation(s) is fed to the app.
The web application implements Cloud Vision API to study the source and extract the equation(s).
Equation(s) to be solved can also be spoken to Algebraic Equation GPT V3.5 and/or edited.
The extracted equation is fed to an LLM which then analyses and solves it.
A solution, together with its comprehensive explanation is output to the user.
This is the UPGRADED BETA version of previous version of Algebraic Equation GPT.

# SETUP STEPS: #
Algebraic Equation GPT V3.5 works independent of Text Extraction Capability.
Speech to Text capabilities is added for an additional option of query input.

- To run a WEB HOSTED version of Algebraic Equation GPT.

  Access https://ironmanfpv.github.io/Algebraic-Equation-GPT-V3.5/ in browser.
  Have your OPEN AI API key and your Cloud Vision API key (optional) ready. Section C and F is applies. The rest of the sections may be skipped.

- To run a LOCAL HOSTED version of Algebraic Equation GPT3.5 and have the Image Text Extraction Capability, read all sections. 

## A. Set up Credentials ##

1.  Create a Google Cloud Project at http://cloud.google.com/
2.  Click Console>Quick Access>APIs and Services>+ Enable API and Services>Choose Cloud Vision API
3.  In the Google Cloud console, go to menu\>API &Services\>Credentials.
4.  Create your OAuth client ID : Call it Web Client 1 (Name of your choice).
5.  Click the named Web application ; (Web Client 1):
        Authorised  JavaScript origins \> URL 1 : http://localhost:8000 
        Authorised  Redirect URIs \> URL 1 : http://localhost:8000/
6.  Click Create or Save.
7.  Note your Client ID.

## B. Generate Cloud Vision API keys ##

1.  This step can be skipped if text from image recognition is not used.
2.  Under API & Services\>Credentials
3.  Create credentials \> API keys
4.  Note your API keys and copy it onto a clipboard storing it to somewhere safe.

## C. Generate OPENAI API keys ##

1.  Access OPENAI>API and Sign up or Log in.
2.  Click settings (Nut icon on top right, beside profile).
3.  Left Column, under organisation >API Keys> + Create New Secret Key.
4.  Select Key owned by you> Type in Name>Select Default project > Click Create Secret Key.
5.  Click Copy to copy the secret key. Store it somewhere safe to be used in Algebraic Equation GPT V3.5 for log in.

## D. Download Code IDE and installations  ##

1.  Install VS code and all its relevant extensions. Extensions : Python, node
2.  In VS Code, run a copy of this project from GitHub repository.
3.  To enable text detection capabilities, key in your Cloud Vision API keys.

## E. Procedure to running a local version of Algebriac Equation GPT ##

1.  In VS code, ensure Node, NPM are updated extensions.
2.  In VS code project tab, click on index.html, close all other terminals and nodes.
2.  Call up a new terminal.
3.  In your working directory prompt, run node.
4.  In your working directory prompt, install the http-server package by typing : npm install http-server
5.  In your working directory prompt, start a web server: npx http-server -p 8000
6.  In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000, or click on one of the 2 generated URL, app will load.
7.  Key in your name.
8.  Key in your OPENAI API key and click confirmed. (Ensure both name and API keys are entered.)
9.  Key in your Cloud Vision API key if you would like to use text recognition capabilities (This is optional)
10.  In the Upload window, click "Choose file" to select a picture (JPEG or PNG) containing a Math equation.
11. In the Extract Equation Window, Click "Read" to extract equation, "Clear" to clear the window. 
12. In the Solution and Explanation window, Click "Solve, Analyse and Explain" to seek solution.
13. If solution is cryptic or unclear, repeating Step 11 will regenerate another output.
14. Click "Exit" to end the app.
15. AR device functions are not developed at the time of commit.

## F. Procedure to use a hosted version of Algebriac Equation GPT ##

1.  Key in your name.
2.  Key in your OPENAI API key and click confirmed. (Ensure both name and API keys are entered.)
3.  Key in your Cloud Vision API key if you would like to use text recognition capabilities (This is optional)
4.  In the Extract Equation Window, type in the Equation you would like Algebraic Equation GPT to be solved, analysed and explained.
5.  Alternatively, Click and hold "Say Equation" to activate mic for audio equation input. Release the button to transcribe audio.
6.  In the Solution and Explanation window, Click "Solve, Analyse and Explain" to seek solution.
7.  If solution is cryptic or unclear, repeating Step 11 will regenerate another output.
8.  Click "Exit" to end the app, logging out, resetting application to default.
